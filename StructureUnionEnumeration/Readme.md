# 1. Structure

- It is a user-defined data type that is used to combine data of different types.

- A structure has to be defined before being usable in the program. It is defined using `struct` keyword.

- We can access it using (.) Operator.


# 2. Union

- It is a user-defined datatype in which we can define members of different types of data types just like structures.

- It is defined by using `Union` Keyword.


## Difference btw Strcture and Union

- unlike a structure, where each member has its own memory, a union member shares the same memory location.


# 3. Enumeration

- It is also known as `Enum`
- It is a user-defined type that consists of a set of named integral constants.

- Enumerations help make the code more readable and easier to maintain by assigning meaningful names to constants.
